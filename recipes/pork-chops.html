    <p>
        Pork chops with a glossy apple cider glaze is really easy, and while there's no starch or extra butter involved, it reduces quickly to a thick, rich, sweet-tart apple syrup.

            <li>
                1 tablespoon butter

            <li>
                3 cloves garlic, minced 
            </li>
            <li>
                Â¼ cup apple cider vinegar 
            </li>
            <li>
                2 cups apple cider 
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
            </li>
            <li>
                1 teaspoon minced rosemary 
            </li>
            <li>
                1 pinch red pepper flakes 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Season pork chops with salt and black pepper.

            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil and butter in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork chops in the hot oil mixture until browned on both sides and pork is slightly pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Remove pan from the heat; transfer pork chops to a plate.

            </li>
            <li>
                Stir garlic into the pan and place over medium-high heat; cook and stir for 30 seconds. Pour in vinegar and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add apple cider and Dijon mustard, bring mixture to a boil, and cook until sauce is reduced and thick, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rosemary and red pepper flakes; season with salt and black pepper to taste.

            </li>
            <li>
                Return pork chops to the pan to warm slightly, 1 to 2 minutes per side.

            </li>
        </ol>
